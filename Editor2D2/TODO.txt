TODO - ScenesAndLayers

OVERVIEW
- finish LayerManagerPane, LayerPane and LayerPropertiesPane
  functionalities
- finish Scene management functionalities
- finish meta data modal

SPECIFICS
- Layer panes
	-- ? add ability to toggle layer visibility in LayerPane
- Placeables should not reference the Controller
	-> fix references to the Controller upon drawing and
	   figure out a way to determine if a Placeable is
	   selected without the Controller's SelectionManager

	
REMEMBER: 	Instance layer selection bug is due to
			an off by one error in the
			selectPlaceables(int,int,int,int).
			
REMEMBER2:
			HotkeyListener becomes messed up when the
			window looses focus or a popup is displayed
			while keys are being held.

LATER
- Layer writer should write whether the Layer is visible
- make sure that GUIComponents dont update on HotkeyListner
  if no expected sequence is held
- make sure that GUIComponent.update is called only upon
  onNotification as often as possible to avoid littering
  the GUI-code with "update()"
- ? should SelectionManagers be declared in the AppState
- de-messify Root
- speedup Tile rendering performance by getting the subimage
  only when the Image the Tile is based on changes
	-- check other Placeables for render optimizations
	-- pay attention to memory usage as well
	   
TASKS LEFT
- write TMove (undo, redo)
	-- add copy and paste (cut?)
- hotkeys (for TMove)
- create abstractions for compiling
	-- compiler is to be implemented on project-by-project
	   basis, and thus, only abstract classes and interfaces
	   need to be written
- make sure that all the functionalities work with minor
  bugs
- finalize graphics
- remove DebugUtils and other debug prints and resources
	-- JohnnyUtils
- fix remaining minor bugs
- create a TEMPLATE module
- remove comments, add Javadoc
