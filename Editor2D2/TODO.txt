TODO - Tools

...

LATER
- return to LayerManagerPane after TOOLS
	-- also check other classes inside "layermgrpane"
- re-examine the architecture of Actions
	-> possibly combine ActionContext with the Action
	   to avoid having to create an extra class for each
	   action
- currently there are off-by-one issues with undoing and
  redoing actions, fix these and make sure that the
  ActionHistory actually works
