TODO - LoadSave

OVERVIEW
- create at least a skeleton for saving and loading of Projects

SPECIFICS
- add ability to create a new Project
- add ability to save a Project

LATER
- return to LayerManagerPane after TOOLS
	-- also check other classes inside "layermgrpane"
- currently there are off-by-one issues with undoing and
  redoing actions, fix these and make sure that the
  ActionHistory actually works
- Placeables should not reference the Controller
	-> fix references to the Controller upon drawing and
	   figure out a way to determine if a Placeable is
	   selected without the Controller's SelectionManager
