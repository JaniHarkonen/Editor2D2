TODO - ArchitecturalRethink

- critically examine the current architecture
- make sure that the current architecture is ready for the next
  software components

- figure out the role of the Controller as well as AppState
	* SubscriptionService should be instantiated by Controller as it
	  receives "requests" from the GUI and updates the model
	* AppState is a separate entity from the Controller, Controller
	  does things, while AppState stores things
	* fields used by the Controller should be delegated to the AppState
	* AppState should have methods only for setting and getting
	
	? Make Controller static instead of a singleton as it has no state
		-> otherwise: Application.controller.subscriberService
		
	* Application HAS AN AppState	(PRIVATE)
	* Application HAS A Controller	(PUBLIC)
	* Application HAS Resources		(PUBLIC)
	* Application HAS A Window		(PUBLIC)
	
	* Controller HAS A SubscriptionService
	* Controller DEALS WITH AN AppState
	
	* Window HAS A SubscriptionService
	
	* make sure that changes to the model go through Controller
		-> example: creating new assets
		-> example: placing placeables
		-> example: creating new layers
