OVERVIEW


SPECIFICS

	

LATER
- return to LayerManagerPane after TOOLS
	-- also check other classes inside "layermgrpane"
- currently there are off-by-one issues with undoing and
  redoing actions, fix these and make sure that the
  ActionHistory actually works
- Placeables should not reference the Controller
	-> fix references to the Controller upon drawing and
	   figure out a way to determine if a Placeable is
	   selected without the Controller's SelectionManager
- ? should SelectionManagers be declared in the AppState
- de-messify Root
- ? should JOptionsPane be placed under Window
- speedup Tile rendering performance by getting the subimage
  only when the Image the Tile is based on changes
	-- check other Placeables for render optimizations
	-- pay attention to memory usage as well
	   
TASKS LEFT
- finish Tools and Actions (undo, redo)
- add Tools to the Toolbar
- add Meta Data modal
- create abstractions for compiling
	-- compiler is to be implemented on project-by-project
	   basis, and thus, only abstract classes and interfaces
	   need to be written
- make sure that all the functionalities work with minor
  bugs
- hotkeys
- finalize graphics
- remove DebugUtils and other debug prints and resources
	-- JohnnyUtils
- fix remaining minor bugs
- create a TEMPLATE module
- remove comments, add Javadoc
