TODO - Later

OVERVIEW
- Implement all the changes that were supposed to be implemented
  "later"

SPECIFICS
- create abstractions for compiling
	-- compiler is to be implemented on project-by-project
	   basis, and thus, only abstract classes and interfaces
	   need to be written

LATER


TASKS LEFT
- finalize graphics
- remove DebugUtils and other debug prints and resources
	-- JohnnyUtils
- fix remaining minor bugs
	-- remove ability to copy unplaced Placeables
	-- remove ability to place placed Placeables
	-- refresh SceneView after removing an Asset
	-- deselect all Placeables after removing an Asset
	-- selection is not being rendered when selection
	   starting coordinates are less than ending coords
	-- selection ignores SPACE being held
- create a TEMPLATE module
- remove comments, add Javadoc
	-- CImage and CIcon need getters/setters???
		-> public fields
	-- remove ColorPreviewPanel default constructor
	   as the default panel has NULL color and NULL
	   value which cannot be later changed
	   	-> default panel will likely crash
	   	-> other solution is to add setters/getters
	-- potential error in Asset documentation
		-> assetClassName is NOT used to reference 
		the asset in factories???
	-- Handles in model
		-- figure out who is the Vendor of 
		   LAYER_VISIBILITY
		-- who is the Vendor of LAYER_REORDER
	-- add <br/><br/>
