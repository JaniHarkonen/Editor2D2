TODO - ToolDevelopment

OVERVIEW
- flesh out the existing tools so that they can be used
  for any Placeable
- achieve close to full functionality for layers

SPECIFICS
V determine if ActionContexts can be combined with their
  respective Actions
V fully develope TPlace (includes APlace)
V fully develope TSelect (includes TSelect)

V switching between layers
V placing onto any layer
V selecting on any layer
- switching between Scenes impacts the layer pane
V ability to change opacity from the slider
- determine if "visiblity"-checkbox is needed

LATER
- return to LayerManagerPane after TOOLS
	-- also check other classes inside "layermgrpane"
- currently there are off-by-one issues with undoing and
  redoing actions, fix these and make sure that the
  ActionHistory actually works
- Placeables should not reference the Controller
	-> fix references to the Controller upon drawing and
	   figure out a way to determine if a Placeable is
	   selected without the Controller's SelectionManager
- convert occurrences of opacity to percentage conversion
  to using Layer's conversion methods
