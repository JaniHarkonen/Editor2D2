TODO - MajorBugfixes

OVERVIEW
- make sure that all required functionalities have been
  implemented and generally work as intended

SPECIFICS
- test project Project tab
	-- test saving a project
		o Layer writer should write whether the Layer is visible
		o Scenes should write the compilation statement
	-- test saving project as
- test AssetPane
	-- test creating assets / folders
	-- test multiple assets
	-- test renaming assets / folders
	-- test editing assets / folders
	-- test deleting assets / folders
- test SceneControlsPane
	-- test resizing
	-- test grid settings
	-- test grid toggles
- test Tools and Toolbar
	-- test Tool switching
	-- test Tool hotkeys
	-- test Tool tooltip
	-- display Tool description
	-- test selection, additive, subtractive (undo, redo)
	-- test move (undo, redo)
	-- test place selection, deletion, allow stack, single (undo, redo)
	-- test flood fill (undo, redo)
	-- test rotate (undo, redo)
	-- test scale, vertical, horizontal (undo, redo)
- test LayerManagerPane
	-- test layer selection
	-- test layer visibility toggle
	-- test layer addition
	-- test layer deletion
	-- test layer editing
		o test back
		o test name, validation
		o test setting grid dimensions
		o test setting opacity
		o test setting visibility

- ModalWindow shouldn't close if there still are tabs open,
  instead, the active tab should close


REMEMBER: 	Instance layer selection bug is due to
			an off by one error in the
			selectPlaceables(int,int,int,int).
			
REMEMBER2:
			HotkeyListener becomes messed up when the
			window looses focus or a popup is displayed
			while keys are being held.

LATER
- make sure that GUIComponents dont update on HotkeyListner
  if no expected sequence is held
- make sure that GUIComponent.update is called only upon
  onNotification as often as possible to avoid littering
  the GUI-code with "update()"
- ? should SelectionManagers be declared in the AppState
- de-messify Root
- speedup Tile rendering performance by getting the subimage
  only when the Image the Tile is based on changes
	-- check other Placeables for render optimizations
	-- pay attention to memory usage as well
- fix object selection and selection rendering
	   
TASKS LEFT
- create abstractions for compiling
	-- compiler is to be implemented on project-by-project
	   basis, and thus, only abstract classes and interfaces
	   need to be written
- make sure that all the functionalities work with minor
  bugs
- finalize graphics
- remove DebugUtils and other debug prints and resources
	-- JohnnyUtils
- fix remaining minor bugs
- create a TEMPLATE module
- remove comments, add Javadoc
