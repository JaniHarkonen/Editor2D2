TODO - Later

OVERVIEW
- Implement all the changes that were supposed to be implemented
  "later"

SPECIFICS
- EObjects should write their sprites
- EObjects should read their sprites
- Scene bounds are currently rendered as a giant rectangle
	-- only render bounds when they are visible
- make sure that GUIComponent.update is called only upon
  onNotification as often as possible to avoid littering
  the GUI-code with "update()"
- create abstractions for compiling
	-- compiler is to be implemented on project-by-project
	   basis, and thus, only abstract classes and interfaces
	   need to be written

LATER


TASKS LEFT
- make sure that all the functionalities work with minor
  bugs
- finalize graphics
- remove DebugUtils and other debug prints and resources
	-- JohnnyUtils
- fix remaining minor bugs
	-- remove ability to copy unplaced Placeables
	-- remove ability to place placed Placeables
	-- refresh SceneView after removing an Asset
	-- deselect all Placeables after removing an Asset
	-- selection is not being rendered when selection
	   starting coordinates are less than ending coords
	-- selection ignores SPACE being held
- create a TEMPLATE module
- remove comments, add Javadoc
