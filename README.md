# Editor2D v.2.0.0 (unfinished)

Re-write of the Editor2D level editor (hence the 2.0.0).
Editor2D is a framework designed to function as the core for 2D tile-based level editors. The framework has been
written very modularly so that it can easily be extended any 2D game project. Not only can Editor2D be extended,
it can also be used as-is by simply running the project.
